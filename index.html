  <h1> Wanna Know - Idealism</h1>
  <p>Do I wanna know?
    If this feeling flows both ways?
    Sad to see you go
    Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
    Baby, we both know
    That the nights were mainly made
    For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day
    Crawling back to you
    Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
    Cause I always do
    Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
    Now I've thought it through</p>
